## Circular locations

## Two circles locations
This problem is usually a bit harder to optimize.

## Technical details
I added the 1-circle and 2-circle locations because it's known which way is the optimal one.

**Note**: The distance graph doesn't track duplicant points.
**Note**: This project uses C# **and** Python3.
